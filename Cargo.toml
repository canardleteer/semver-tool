# NOTE(canardleteer): `regex_generate` requires an older `rand`, and I think

#                     size to the binary however (1MB), that we should seek to
#                     reduce.
#
#                     Both are currently required for `sem-tool generate`, but
#                     the right place to fix this, is inside `regex_generate`.

# NOTE(canardleteer): The inclusion of default `regex` added 3MB to the release

#                     mouth. Since we don't really currently use `regex` for
#                     much other than parsing a single string per application
#                     run, I think it's reasonable to shrink down the dependency
#                     tree at a performance cost.

#                     harder to use with common tools like `yq`, and I haven't
